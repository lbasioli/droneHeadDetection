Part of the solution to the task given for evaluation of data science candidate.

Initial commit has most of the required code for model training, but some things are not done yet which is indicated in the code.

Model has not been trained because not enough computing resources are available. Therefore, code is not fully tested and even the parts that should be completed are probaly bugged.

An older version of the model has been trained before, it's output is saved and it can be used for evaluation. One should mention that the older model used whole train dataset for training but did not use any augments, was not evaluated and nominally has 4 output classes of detected objects, but actually has only 1.

Data visualization is not done as requested. Only the MOT HT21 challange data is used and only demonstration frames can be shown, not demonstration video.
